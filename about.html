          <p>We operate in one of the wealthiest counties in the country, which is also the most racially disparate county in California. Our work addresses two fundamental challenges Marin youth face: Adequate access to extracurricular and athletic opportunity in Marin City. Lack of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity in the broader Marin community.</p>

          <h2 class="about-page_block-header__2nZcQ">Our Mission</h2>
          <p>Play Marin intentionally provides opportunities for children of diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds in Southern Marin to learn and grow together through play. We recognize the need for stronger diversity and inclusion in Marin County, and we believe that bringing together the unique experiences of different cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds among us serves to enhance our larger community.</p>
          <p>Being able to understand and appreciate people from all walks of life is vital to the advancement of our society, and we see play as the vehicle to achieve this goal. In just eight years, we have grown from one basketball team of nine players to reaching over 300 kids annually through several team sports and many other uplifting and enriching activities. Our work teaches valuable skills, creates friendships, develops grit, brings families together, and enhances well being and solidarity among young people of Marin from all backgrounds, improving their prospects for a successful future and benefiting the overall health of our broader Marin community.</p>
          <p>Come play with us.</p>

After serving for several years as Director of Recreation for Marin City Community Center, Tamalpais High graduate Mr. Austin, who studied Early Childhood Education at Texas Southern University and holds a Bachelor’s in Psychology from Dominican University in San Rafael, saw a need to create opportunities for Marin City youth to engage in organized athletics and other extracurricular activities. He founded Play Marin to meet that need, and to intentionally give kids of diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds from the broader Marin community the opportunity to play, learn, and grow together. Starting in 2012 with just one basketball team of nine players, Mr. Austin’s dedicated stewardship of Play Marin brought steady and expansive growth. The organization currently serves approximately 300 kids annually.</p>
